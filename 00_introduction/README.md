# Introduction

The objective of this section is to introduce 
the basic concepts for the development.
It starts with examples of *textio* package 
to create an automated way to initiliaze the data memories
as well as check and validate the algorithms output.

In example 05 an array is loaded from a text file 
to a BRAM, then the BRAM data is stored in a text file, in a second step.
This is a handy way to validate the algorithms.
