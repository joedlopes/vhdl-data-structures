# Data Structures with VHDL

This is a VHDL introductionary course to learn VHDL by developing data structure algorithms: sorting, search, tree, and graphs.

The main goal is to use GHDL as basis for the development.


## Enviroment Setup

Before we start our journey into coding, you may install the development software.

In Linux enviroments you can run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ghdl gtkwave
```

For Windows and MacOS, you may refer to the ghdl's [website](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases).

For scripting, used to generate data for verificiation and so on you can install:

```bash
python3 -m pip install flake8 pycodestyle black pydantic opencv-python
```
